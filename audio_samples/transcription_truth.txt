My name is Ethan. I was asked to come here by eleven. Now it is already 3pm. They did not even serve me any food or drinks. Terrible!

Help me! I can't find my parents. They told me to wait for them but I saw this pretty butterfly and followed it. Now I am lost!

What should I have for lunch? There's only yong tau foo, western, japanese, economic rice stalls here. I am sick of the choices here.

Preach, will now have the strength of the black panther, stripped away!
